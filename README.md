=========

All of these projects reference various Pivotal HD libraries using Maven.  These libraries are not currently in a public Maven repo, so you'll need to install them by hand.

The dependency directory contains an install script and tarball of the required libraries.  Execute the install.sh script to install them and build the gpxf-test library.  If you add a new Pivotal HD library (or some other publicly unavailable third party library) to a project that is not in this folder, then please update the dependency tar ball and the install script.
