pxf-field
=========

All of these projects reference various Pivotal HD libraries using Maven.  These libraries are largely in the Spring Source repository.  This repository is referenced in each of the PXF projects.

The dependency directory contains an install script and tarball of the required libraries.  Execute the install.sh script to install them and build the pxf-test library.

Documentation on these extensions is maintained at http://pivotal-field-engineering.github.io/pxf-field/index.html
